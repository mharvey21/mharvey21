### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Michael, and I am currently a second year college student at Notre Dame. I am currently working on a class project, creating a indy game using C++. 
I am trying to improve my coding skills while also focusing on completing school.
I will use GitHub to find relatable projects to learn off of.
